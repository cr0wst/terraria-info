# terraria-info
Informational files for the game Terraria.  Providing both CSV and JSON format for the use in APIs.  

Some of this information comes from the Terraria Crafting Recipes spreadsheet I found on Google docs.  I could not, however, find information about the author.  Some of the other information comes from the [Official Terraria Wiki](http://terraria.gamepedia.com).

Information on the Wiki and in the spreadsheet is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.  This data is under the same licensing.

# Future Plans
I plan on implementing an API service for this information to help the Terraria community in creating bots, apps, and other services requiring the data.

# Pull Requests
Please submit a pull request with updates to the CSV files.  Once they are accepted, a process will convert them to JSON automatically.
